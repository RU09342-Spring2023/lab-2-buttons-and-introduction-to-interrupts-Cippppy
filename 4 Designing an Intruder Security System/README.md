# Lab Exercise 2: Interrupts and Energy Trace
The purpose of this lab is to explore the input functionality of the Microprocessor and begin looking at interrupts. You will also be looking into a very power tool within Code Composer: Energy Trace, which allows you to see power consumption of your processor and design. You will then interface a PIR sensor to your board to be able to do occupancy detection. Finally, you will design an intruder alarm system, which will notify a user that the system is armed, indicated when a person is detected, and then finally set an "alarm" when they stay too long.

## Assignment
Each of the following bullet items are in their own numeric folder and meant to go in order.

To complete this assignment, you will need to:
- [ ] 1. Investigate the Buttons on the Launchpad and configure Pullup/Pulldown Resistors for them to work correctly.
- [ ] 2. Learn about the Interrupt Routine and how it interfaces with your software.
- [ ] 3. Use Interrupts to implement the alternative blinking LED example from Lab 1
- [ ] 4. Explore how interrupts can be used to save power versus polling.
- [ ] 5. Design the Intruder Security System
